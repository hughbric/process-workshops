# Process Review

Get better at programming fluently.

## Why should I do this?

For a number of reasons.

Practicing writing code while under observation helps show you how good your current process is - where do you get stuck, how are you debugging, how's your approach to TDD - and therefore an accelerated way to improve.

Usefully you'll get feedback from your pair, and a recording to re-watch yourself write code.

It's great feedback and confidence-boosting to show yourself you're getting better at programming.
